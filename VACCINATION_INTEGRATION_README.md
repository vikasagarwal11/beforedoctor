│   └── vaccination_coverage_service.dart  # Main service
└── features/voice/presentation/screens/
    └── voice_logger_screen.dart          # Updated with vaccination detection
```

### Key Components

#### 1. VaccinationCoverageService
```dart
// Core vaccination tracking functionality
class VaccinationCoverageService {
  // Check vaccination status for a child
  static Map<String, dynamic> checkVaccinationStatus({...})
  
  // Log vaccination via voice command
  static Map<String, dynamic> logVaccination({...})
  
  // Extract vaccination info from voice
  static Map<String, dynamic> extractVaccinationFromVoice(String voiceInput)
  
  // Generate vaccination reminders
  static List<Map<String, dynamic>> generateReminders({...})
}
```

#### 2. Voice Integration
```dart
// Added to voice_logger_screen.dart
final vaccinationAnalysis = VaccinationCoverageService.extractVaccinationFromVoice(symptom);

if (vaccinationAnalysis['is_vaccination'] == true) {
  // Process vaccination information
  // Add vaccination insights to AI response
  // Log vaccination event
}
```

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Voice Commands That Work
```
✅ "Aarav got his flu shot today"
✅ "Log Vihaan's MMR vaccination"
✅ "Emma received her DTaP vaccine yesterday"
✅ "Check if we're missing any vaccines"

```

### AI Response Enhancement
When vaccination is detected, the AI response includes:
```
💉 Vaccination Analysis:
• Detected Vaccine: DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis)
• Coverage Status: 75.0% complete
• Missing Vaccines: 3
• Completed Vaccines: 7
• Recommendations: Complete DTaP vaccination series, Start Hepatitis A vaccination series
```
