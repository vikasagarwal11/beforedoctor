```

### 3. Flutter Integration
```dart
// In your Flutter app
import 'package:beforedoctor/services/diseases_symptoms_service.dart';

final diseasesService = DiseasesSymptomsService();
await diseasesService.initialize();

// Analyze symptoms
final analysis = await diseasesService.analyzeSymptoms('fever and cough');
```
