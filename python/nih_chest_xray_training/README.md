## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Download Dataset

```bash
# Navigate to python directory
cd python

# Run download script
python download_nih_dataset.py
```

This will:
- Create necessary directories
- Provide download instructions
- Create placeholder files for testing
- Verify dataset structure

### Step 2: Manual Download (Required)

Due to Kaggle authentication requirements, manual download is needed:

1. **Visit**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data
2. **Download**: Click the "Download" button
3. **Extract**: Extract the ZIP file
4. **Copy Files**:
   - Copy `Data_Entry_2017.csv` to `python/nih_chest_xray_training/data/`
   - Copy `images/` folder to `python/nih_chest_xray_training/data/extracted/`

### Step 3: Process Data

```bash
# Process the NIH dataset
python nih_chest_xray_training/nih_data_processor.py
```

This will:
- Extract pediatric cases (age < 18)
- Identify respiratory symptoms
- Generate Flutter integration code
- Save processed data

### Step 4: Train Models

```bash
# Train NIH models
python nih_chest_xray_training/train_nih_models.py
```

This will:
- Train symptom classification model
- Train severity assessment model
- Train urgency assessment model
- Generate Flutter integration

## 📊 Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Extraction
- **Input**: `Data_Entry_2017.csv` (metadata)
- **Process**: Filter pediatric cases (age < 18)
- **Output**: Pediatric respiratory symptom cases

### 2. Symptom Mapping
```python
pediatric_conditions = {
    'pneumonia': ['pneumonia', 'consolidation', 'infiltrate'],
    'atelectasis': ['atelectasis', 'collapse'],
    'effusion': ['effusion', 'pleural'],
    'edema': ['edema', 'congestion'],
    'cardiomegaly': ['cardiomegaly', 'enlarged heart'],
    # ... more conditions
}
```

### 3. Severity Assessment
- **High**: Pneumonia, effusion, cardiomegaly, edema
- **Medium**: Atelectasis, mass, nodule, consolidation
- **Low**: Other conditions

### 4. Urgency Assessment
- **Urgent**: High severity + young age (<5 years)
- **High**: High severity + older age
- **Routine**: Low/medium severity

## 🤖 Model Training

### Models Trained

### Voice Logging Enhancement
The NIH dataset enhances voice logging by:
- **Respiratory Symptom Recognition**: Identify pneumonia, effusion, etc.
- **Severity Assessment**: Determine condition severity
- **Urgency Recommendations**: Suggest appropriate care level

### Example Voice Inputs
```
"My 5-year-old has a fever and cough"
→ Detected: Pneumonia, Severity: High, Urgency: Urgent

"Child has chest pain and difficulty breathing"
→ Detected: Effusion, Severity: High, Urgency: High

"Baby has a mild cough"
→ Detected: Mild respiratory symptoms, Severity: Low, Urgency: Routine
```

### Clinical Recommendations
- **Urgent**: Seek immediate medical attention
- **High**: Schedule doctor appointment within 24 hours
- **Routine**: Schedule routine check-up

# Alternative: Use Kaggle API
pip install kaggle
kaggle datasets download -d nih-chest-xrays/data
```

#### 2. Memory Issues
```python
# Reduce batch size in training
batch_size = 32  # Reduce from 64
```

#### 3. Processing Errors
```bash
# Check file permissions
chmod -R 755 python/nih_chest_xray_training/

# Verify Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Model Training Failures
```bash
# Force CPU training
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""

# Check available memory
free -h  # Linux
# or
wmic computersystem get TotalPhysicalMemory  # Windows
```
